  This file was created automatically as the result of the scaffold generator.
  If you decide to use TailwindCSS in your project then you can safely delete
  this file, but first remove the <div className="rw-scaffold"> from the Layout
  that your scaffold is wrapped in. Check the comment blocks below for a
  couple of config options you'll need to add to Tailwind to preserve the
  scaffold appearance.

  If you don't use Tailwind then you should keep it here until you have
  completely converted your scaffolded pages or removed them, or if you don't
  mind your scaffolded pages being monumentally ugly.
